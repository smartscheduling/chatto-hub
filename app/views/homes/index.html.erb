      <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
      <p>
      Chatto is a suite of tools designed for the modern Data Scientist.  The goal of Chatto is to allow you
      and your team to get up and running as fast as possible, easily communicate with each other, and do what
      you do best: discover insights and make the world a better place.

      <h4>SLACK</h4>
      <p>
      After signing into Chatto for the first time, you should receive an email invitation to join the Critical Data team on Slack.
      Please accept that invitation and set up a Slack account if you don't already have one.  When a new project
      is created, a Slack channel will automatically be created with the same project name.  Use this channel to
      communicate with your team, share links, and stay up to date with Datathon news.

      <h4>GITHUB REPOSITORY</h4>
      <p>
      When creating a project on Chatto, a Github repository will automatically be created for you on the Critical
      Data Github organization.  The repository will contain a templated file structure and useful tools for
      transforming the data.  If you want your teammates to be able to push to the repository make sure to add them
      as <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/">collaborators</a>.

      <p>
      Chatto Transform is an open source library for connecting to data sources and transforming data. It focuses on
      connecting the user to the data with as little fuss as possible, and providing ways to collaboratively build up
      dataset-specific transformations over time.  <a href="https://github.com/smartscheduling/chatto-transform-open-source#installation">Installation instructions for Chatto Transform can be found here.</a>
